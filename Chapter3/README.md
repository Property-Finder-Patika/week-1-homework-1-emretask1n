If the function f returns a non-finite `float64` value, the SVG file will contain invalid `<polygon>` elements (although many SVG renderers handle this gracefully). Modify the program to skip invalid polygons.


## [Exercise 3.2](https://github.com/Property-Finder-Patika/week-1-homework-1-emretask1n/tree/main/Chapter3/exercises/ex3.2)

Experiment with visualizations of other functions from the math package. Can you produce an `egg box`, `moguls`, or a `saddle`?


## [Exercise 3.3](https://github.com/Property-Finder-Patika/week-1-homework-1-emretask1n/tree/main/Chapter3/exercises/ex3.3)

Color each polygon based on its height, so that the peaks are colored red (#ff0000) and the valleys blue (#0000ff)
